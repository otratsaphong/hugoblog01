This blog focuses on my options trading experiment with a small $500 account.

The goal of the experiment is to grow the account from $500 to $5,000 by conservatively trading options in the US market. This is called the $500 challenge by some. I call it the $500 experiment.

In this experiment I'm sticking with the KISS principle. Keep It Simple.

I will only look at the SPY, which represents the broad market.

I will be using the Butterfly strategy, which I have found handles volatility very well.

I am also experimenting with the Calendar strategy, which I quite like.

When learning to trade options, it is best to start with a small amount of money that you are not dependent on.

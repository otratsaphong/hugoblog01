# Learning to trade as a path to self discovery and personal growth

This is something quite unexpected! When I first became interested in learning to trade, It was primarily as a means of making money. What I learnt along the way was something much greater.

In learning to become a successful trader, I had to overcome my fears. Fear of losing money and selling too soon. Fear of losing money and failing to commit to the trade, and missing out on a big opportunity.

Coming to terms with loss. Loss of opportunity. Loss of money that I could have made.

Learning to handle one's greed. No, this doesn't apply to me. You want to bet? Trust me, you will have to deal with greed on your path to becoming a successful trader.

Still with me?

Let's continue.

Most people drop out after a few weeks. Too hard! Not enough time! Too busy!

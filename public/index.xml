      <description>The market has been dropping brutally over the last couple of weeks. It looks like it has come to a support level.
Below is a chart of Apple (AAPL), which is a proxie for the broader market. It looks like the market could go up or go sideways.
To take advantage of this situation I will sell a 29 July PUT Vertical.
SELL -1 VERTICAL AAPL 100 (Weeklys) 29 JUL 22 130/120 PUT @3.</description>

      <description>Trading options is a risky business. When I first learned to trade options I was so scared of losing my money that I didn&amp;rsquo;t trade options for a long time.
The options course that I took, focused on buying options. As on options buyer, you have to get the market direction right to be able to make a profit.
A few years after doing my options course, I learned that it was more profitable to sell options.</description>

      <description>R Markdown This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc. There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>This blog focuses on my options trading experiment with a small $500 account.
The goal of the experiment is to grow the account from $500 to $5,000 by conservatively trading options in the US market. This is called the $500 challenge by some. I call it the $500 experiment.
In this experiment I&amp;rsquo;m sticking with the KISS principle. Keep It Simple.
I will only look at the SPY, which represents the broad market.</description>
